At the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis the Danish artist Claus Haxholm reached out to me to do an interview by email. It turned out to be a lengthy email exchange which resulted in an interview available on the Danish music website [Passive/Aggressive](http://passiveaggressive.dk).

In the interview (which is in Danish unfortunately) I talk about the brain, morphology, Norway, time and different speculative subjects related to computer music, as well as my Vortex system.
