Here you will find the material for the introductory workshop held at Notam, Oslo in late summer 2019.

The slides may be used as a sort of cheatsheet as well as notes for remembering the topics covered:

• An overview: What is SuperCollider and what can you do with it?
  
• The design and architecture of SuperCollider
  
• Language basics: syntax, variables, expressions and functions
  
• Learning resources: How to proceed from here
