A while ago I started compiling a list of links to SuperCollider based things that I found interesting and wanted to save for later.

The list grew and at one point I organized it all in one public repository where the SuperCollider community could help curate links to *awesome SuperCollider things* and it has since then become a truly rich resource for things like tutorials, reading material, nice projects and tools.

Have a look, and do add to it if you feel like it:
