## Install wine

To get wine installed properly, you need to make sure you have the `multilib` repostories enabled. [See the Arch Linux wiki for more information on the multilib repositories](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Official_repositories#multilib).

This enables 32 bit support for `wine`, which is nice to have anyways. 

with this installed you can install wine: `sudo pacman -S wine`
