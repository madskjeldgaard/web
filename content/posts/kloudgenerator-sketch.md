A cloud generator is basically a synthesis process that generates a lot of micro sound events (grains) at the same time. This as a whole becomes  a bigger textural structure called a "cloud" generally.

I have done a lot of experiments lately using SuperCollider's pattern library to sequence micro compositions on a per-sound-particle basis, but to take a break from that work (which rarely leads to succesful results I have to say), I challenged myself a bit and tried to make an audio rate granular synthesis cloud generator. Here it is for your perusal.
